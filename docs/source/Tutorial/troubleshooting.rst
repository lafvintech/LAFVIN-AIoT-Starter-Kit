Reset Device
------------------------------------------

If you encounter problems that cannot be resolved, you can try resetting the device:

**Network Reconfiguration (Xiaozhi version)**

1. Press and hold the "boot" button when the device is powered on, and the device will re-enter network configuration mode

**Reflash Firmware**

1. Follow the steps in :ref:`firmware_upload` to reflash the firmware. After flashing is complete, you need to reconfigure the network (if you did not unbind the device in the backend before flashing, the device will automatically connect to the previously bound agent)
