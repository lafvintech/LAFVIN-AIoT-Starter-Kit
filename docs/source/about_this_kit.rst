Project Overview
==================

The XiaoZhi AIoT Starter Kit is a next-generation IoT control kit developed based on the open-source xiaozhi-esp32 project. This kit uses the ESP32-S3 as the core controller and innovatively introduces the MCP (Model Context Protocol), enabling AI large language models to directly understand and control hardware devices.

Through natural language commands, users can easily control lighting, monitor environments, and operate devices, experiencing truly AI-native smart home technology. The kit is suitable for beginners learning IoT and AI technologies, while also providing developers with a powerful prototyping platform.
